  = Profile Summary
  I have a good background in building backend applications, especially focusing on performance optimizations.
  All projects I've worked were setup to be Docker-friendly. \

  Throughout the projects I've worked on, I've have used specialized technologies, like OPC-UA for IIoT, ANTLR
  to designing a DSL and OR-Tools for IP/LP problems. \

  I have used Python and Java for big projects, Scala and C\# on smaller side-projects and Rust
  for personal projects and would love to try programming with it for work.

= Professional Experience
#entry(
  title: "Software Engineer",
  date: "2024 - Present",
  institution: "Ready2Use S.r.l.",
  location: "Italia, Abruzzo, Pescara",
)[
  - Developed Java 21 microservices deployed with Kubernetes in a Google Cloud Platform
    environment via GitHub actions.

  - Developed RESTful APIs and integrated third-party services like Camunda 7, while
    also designing a DSL to integrate in Camunda forms to inject validation / assertions
    and integrating validation in the already existing APIs.

  - Worked on setting up multiple Linux machines to have an internal testing
    environment to check difficult-to-replicate behaviours.
    (e.g. Reverse Proxy, SSL, Docker, etc..)


  - Created multiple Azure pipelines which builds a Docker image and deploys
    updated images on the previously mentioned testing environments.

  - Created a Jenkins pipeline which builds a Docker image that
    contains a project, extracts its build and makes scan through Mend CLI.
